      <h2>Our Service Incubation Model</h2>
      <p>
        The Service Incubation model is an alternate funding model for startup
        that allows professionals to offer their services to startups in return
        for a minute equity (usually between 0.5% to 1.5%) in the startup. As a
        service incubator, you will see your share grow as much as 1000% in 12 -
        24 months as been first to invest.

                Most early-stage companies and pre-product startups cannot
                afford professional services especially those who donâ€™t have
                family and friends' network that can support

                If startups can seed 5-10% in equity to incubators for $20k to
                $200k funding most times, they will be willing to seed 10%
                equity for a $25k service investment
